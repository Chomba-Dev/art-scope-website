# üé® Logo Installation Instructions

## üìÇ Save Your Logo Here:

**File Location:** `public/images/logo.jpg`

**Important:** 
- Save the Art Scope Enterprises logo image as `logo.jpg` 
- Place it directly in the `/public/images/` folder
- The file should be named exactly `logo.jpg` (lowercase)

## ‚úÖ What I've Updated:

- Maintains consistent branding throughout the site

### 3. **Favicon & Meta Tags**

- Logo will show when website is shared on social platforms

### 4. **Cleaned Up Files**

## üñºÔ∏è Logo Specifications:

**Current format:** JPG ‚úÖ
**Minimum size:** 200x150 pixels

## üöÄ After Saving the Logo:

1. Save your logo image as `logo.jpg` in `public/images/`
2. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Refresh your browser at http://localhost:3000
4. You should see your beautiful logo in:
   - Header navigation (top left)
   - Footer (company info section)
   - Browser favicon (tab icon)

## üîß Favicon Fix:

The disturbing Next.js icon should now be gone! I've:
- Removed the default Next.js favicon
- Updated all references to use your logo.jpg
- Added explicit favicon links in the HTML head
- Restarted the server to clear caches

If you still see the Next.js icon, try:
1. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try incognito/private browsing mode

**Your logo looks absolutely professional! The navy blue and yellow design perfectly matches the website's color scheme.** üéâ
